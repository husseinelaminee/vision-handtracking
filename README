# Vision-based Hand Tracking

The goal of this project is to build a computer-vision-based hand tracking pipeline
that can be used in a simulation context (e.g. SOFA), or even eventually with real hardware.

But the *real* goal is to have fun while experimenting with vision, tracking, and interaction!
